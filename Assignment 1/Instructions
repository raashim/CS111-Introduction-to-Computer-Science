Hello, World [15 points]. This is everyone’s first program. Write a program HelloWorld.java that, when run, displays the phrase: Hello, World
% java HelloWorld
Hello, World


Wind chill [15 points]. Given the temperature T (in degrees Fahrenheit) and the wind speed v (in miles per hour), the National Weather Service defines the effective temperature (the wind chill) as follows:
w = 35.74 + 0.6215 T + (0.4275 T – 35.75) v^0.16
Write a program WindChill.java that takes two double command-line arguments temperature and velocity and prints the wind chill. 
NOTE 1: a^b means a to the power of b. Use Math.pow(a,b) to compute a^b.
NOTE 2: The formula is not valid if T is larger than 50 in absolute value or if v is larger than 120 or less than 3. Assume that the input values testing your program are in range.
NOTE 3: It is not necessary to round the wind chill value, display the value that is computed.
NOTE 4: Do not use loops for this program.
% java WindChill 35.0 10.0
27.445420


Order check [20 points]. Write a program OrderCheck.java that takes four int command-line arguments w, x, y, and z. Define a boolean variable whose value is true if the four values are either in strictly ascending order (w < x < y < z) or strictly descending order (w > x > y > z), and false otherwise. Then, display the boolean variable value.
NOTE 1: Do not use if statements on this program.
NOTE 2: Assume that the inputs will always be integers.
% java OrderCheck 5 10 15 2
false
% java OrderCheck 15 11 9 4
true
